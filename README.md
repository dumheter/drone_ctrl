# drone_ctrl
Reverse engineered the drone controller app to make a program that can take gamepad input to control the drone.

## Background
I have a drone. You control it with an app. It's hard without physical feedback.
So I thought, why not control it with a gamepad instead, how hard can it be?

## Demo
Drone in action
